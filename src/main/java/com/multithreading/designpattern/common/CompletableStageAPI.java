     * completeExceptionally(Throwable)
     * if task is not done yet then it will force the task to be done
     * in exceptional way, ie. get() or join() will throw exception
     * post that if not already completed.
     * <p>
     * obtrudeException(Throwable)
     * if task is done or not done it will force the task to be
     * completed exceptionally. Thrown exception won't be passed
     * exception. passed exception can be seen as a root cause
     * of the final exception thrown.

     * <p>
     * Note: CompletableFuture use jvm fork/pool which have all
     * the demon threads. So that means if you are running any
     * task on that pool it must be service task and if it is
     * not then you better pass executor created poll run your
     * task using CompletableFuture.
     * <p>
     * in contrast Executor pool is of non-demon threads so if
     * you do not shutdown thread pool it won't exit at all.
     * <p>
     * join() and get() are the blocking calls, if done on
     * non-demon thread it will prevent non-demon thread from
     * exiting until completion and inturn keep the demon
     * threads alive.
     * <p>
     * Note: diff between get() and join() is get throws
     * checked exception where as join() throws unchecked
     * exception.
