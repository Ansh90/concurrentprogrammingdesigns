Advantage of using CompletableFuture API over executor API

if you want the result out of Future which will be returned by Exceutor you need to call join() or get() which actually blocks current thread
until Future object received object.

If you wish to use the Future object when available without blocking current execution then consider using chaing offered by
CompletableFuture

Lets say you want to send request to db get get results and log the results and do not wish to block for logging
until recived results from DB you can chain
CompletableFuture.thenApplyAsync(userID_from_db, executors).thenAcceptAsync(Consumer);

Now Consumer can be implemented for logging retured users. Consumer will run on any aviablale thread on
passed executor.
